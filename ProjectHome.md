A second darkness has fallen on the Invincible Light. First, the Creator Shaytana has walked the desert, whose return we await. Then the Regent Richvh goes silent, in the wake of the advent of the Old Gods. But the Light does not fear darkness! Where shadow exists, the zeal of the community shall fill that void! Lux Invicta, the Invincible Light shall never falter.

And thus, to facilitate collaborative development and improvement of Lux Invicta, a collective SVN is best adopted. Project Ownership status will be granted to the four recent active pillars of the community: Numahr, Darkgamma, Futuregary, and Riknap. Should Richvh and Shaytana resume activity, they take precedence in ownership seniority for obvious reasons. As of the fourth day of the seventh month of the thirteenth year of this millenia's era, DarkReborn has been inducted as well.
